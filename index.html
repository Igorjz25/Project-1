<h1> Russian Schools </h1>
<p> (the website is now in procces of creation) In this article  will tell you my experience in Russian Public school byy the example of my school </p>
<hr>
<h2> Education </h2>
<p> By the statistic 98% of Russian population can read write etc . And all this because of Soviet Union's pressing toward the education.
But the level of education in schools are not really good. The education in American schools are not that hard, but the people that
gradueted from American schools are more educated, because the ammount and the way of explanations are balanced, so the student learns the same amount, but successful 
and easier. </p>
<h2> Usual Day </h2>
<p> The usual day of Russian student begins from waking up in 7 AM and dressing up into school uniform and doing all morning activities.
Then he goes to school in 8 am and the lessons starts 8:30. The student is coming in, and giving it to the cloakroom worker, and getting plate with a number.
Then he goes to his classes.
